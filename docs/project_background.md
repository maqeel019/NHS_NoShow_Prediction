# Project Background

## 1. Introduction
Missed medical appointments, called **Did Not Attend (DNA)**, are a big problem for the NHS.  

Every missed appointment wastes time, money, and resources. It also delays care for other patients.  

Each year, millions of appointments are missed, costing the NHS **hundreds of millions of pounds**.

---

## 2. Motivation
Even with reminders like SMS or email, many patients still miss appointments. Common reasons include:

- Forgetting the appointment  
- Transport or travel issues  
- Waiting too long between booking and appointment  
- Personal or work conflicts  
- Age, income, or other social factors  

Most reminder systems send the same message to everyone.  
Using **machine learning**, we can predict which patients are likely to miss and send **targeted reminders**.

---

## 3. Problem Context
The goal is to **predict if a patient will attend or miss** their appointment.  

It is a **binary classification problem**:

- `0` → Patient attends  
- `1` → Patient misses  

We also want the model to **explain why** a patient might miss, so staff can trust the predictions.

## 4. Relevance to the NHS
This project helps the NHS:

- Reduce wasted appointments  
- Plan clinic resources better  
- Send reminders to high-risk patients  
- Understand trends by age, region, and other factors  

Even a **5–10% reduction** in no-shows can save millions of pounds and improve patient care.

---

## 5. Research Basis
Past studies show that no-shows depend on:

- Age, gender, and location  
- Appointment day and time  
- Previous missed appointments  
- SMS or email reminders  
- Distance to clinic  

Many previous models are **non-UK** or not explainable.  
This project uses **UK NHS data** to make predictions relevant for the NHS.

---

## 6. Broader Significance
Predicting no-shows is useful for both **patients and the NHS**:

- Helps vulnerable patients get care  
- Reduces wasted resources  
- Makes healthcare more efficient and fair  

This project supports a **data-driven, patient-friendly NHS**.
